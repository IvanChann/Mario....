Add a Sprout class, Sapling, 

Use GroundFactory to spwan new Sprouts at start.

Sprout, Sapling, Tree and Wall are created as an abstract class of HighGround and then Ground to make it more 
extendable as what does count as a high ground and what doesnt. As a player has to jump on high ground whereas
can walk straight onto floor & dirt.
Hence, following the open closed principle. As it open to extension but not modification.

The HighGround's value is stored in status so we can further find out at what stage the high ground has reached like
for Trees.

10% chance for goomba to spawn at Sprout(+) every turn
10% chance to drop a 20$ coin at Sapling(t) every turn
15% chance to spawn Koopa every turn
20% chance tree dies and become dirt every turn


Every turn we have different options possible for each Tree. Which are implemented using the CapabalitySet.
