Add a Sprout class, Sapling, 

Use GroundFactory to spwan new Sprouts at start.

Sprout, Sapling, Tree and Wall are created as an abstract class of HighGround and then Ground to make it more 
extendable as what does count as a high ground and what doesnt. As a player has to jump on high ground whereas
can walk straight onto floor & dirt.
Hence, following the open closed principle. As it open to extension but not modification.

The HighGround's value is stored in status so we can further find out at what stage the high ground has reached like
for Trees.

10% chance for goomba to spawn at Sprout(+) every turn
10% chance to drop a 20$ coin at Sapling(t) every turn
15% chance to spawn Koopa every turn
20% chance tree dies and become dirt every turn


Every turn we have different options possible for each Tree. Which are implemented using the CapabalitySet.

EDIT FOR ASSIGNMENT 2

Modifed and added an abstract Tree class and added all the trees inherit that abstarct class. To make 
resetting the game easier.
All the trees and high ground inherit the HighGround abstract class to make expanding the game easy.
Following the Open/Closed Principle, so its open for extension but closed for modification.

And everything else inherits the Ground Absract class.

Added an association with multiplicty 1* between Sprout and Goomba as multiple sprouts have chnaces of 
spawning goomba every turn.
Added an association with multiplicty 1* between Sapling and Coin as multiple saplings have chances of 
dropping coins every turn.
Added an association with multiplicty 1* between Mature and Koopa as multiple Mature trees have chances of 
spawning Koopa every turn.
