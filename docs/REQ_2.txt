Added JumpAction that extends Action. The JumpAction will be used by player to jump over higher grounds.

Engine to wall: What actions is the player allowed
wall to engine: The player can perform JumpAction
engine to player: You can do JumpAction on wall

Jump option will be displayed to the user in the menu.

Each object will have a debuff option.
Like Wall has 80% success and 20 fall damage
Sprout has 90% success and 10 fall damage
Sapling has 80% success and 20 fall damage
Mature has 90% success and 30 fall damage

Dependency between HighGround and Status so we can further find out at what stage the high ground has reached like
for Trees or if the player has consumed Super star which means it can go over anything without jumping. 

Dependency between Status and CapabilitySet, as for each HighGround terrain we need to implement what capabilities each
terrain has like the succes rates for each jump of differnet terrain.

Dependency between JumpAction and Status as we need to use this to debuff player depening on different HighGround and different 
success rates for each jump.


EDIT FOR ASSIGNMENT 2

Modification from previous diagram.
Assocaiation between Player and JumpAction, and a player can use JumpAction to jump once each turn.
Hence the 1 by 1 multiplicity.

HighGround has a dependency with ActionList as with each ground we have JumpAction as an allowable action
which gets added to the ActionList and is accessed by the Player to find out what actions can be
performed.
