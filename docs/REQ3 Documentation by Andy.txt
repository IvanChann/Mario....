Added Goomba and Koopa class extending Actor
Initially thought about adding Enemy abstract class to avoid DRY but then realised
the overriden methods in each Enemy class will still be different to each other.

Both Goomba and Koopa's attack damage can be handled by overriding getIntrinsicWeapon

Overriding the PlayTurn method can handle the 10% chance of removing Goomba from the map

Dormant state will be kept as a Boolean within the Koopa class, and Koopa will behave
differently depending on whether it is dormant or not
