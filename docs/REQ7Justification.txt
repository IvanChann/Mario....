ResetAction is a new class that extends from Action.
ResetAction will be added to the Player's actionList in the playTurn method if the player currently has the status "CAN_RESET".
The enum "CAN_RESET" will be added to the capabilityList in the Player's constructor.
Once the user has used ResetAction the capability will be removed and as a result will no longer be able to use ResetAction again.

ResetAction class has a dependency on the GameMap and the Player. It will iterate through each Location in the GameMap and check the reset
conditions eg. if location contains tree, if location contains actor. It will then "reset" those things eg. if it contains a tree 50% 
chance to reset to dirt. Then it will iterate through the Player's CapabilityList and remove any statuses and heal the player to a maximum.

This implementation will only need to add one extra class. As ResetAction extends from Action no other changes need to be made in order to 
implement this class other than adding a few things to the Player class and dependencies are kept to a minimum
clearly showing adherence to the Open-Closed Principle and Dependency Inversion Principle.
Implementing the actual "reset" is made easier as there are many helpful methods in Location and Actor that can be utilized.
