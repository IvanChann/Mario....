Created items package, added Super Mushroom class and Power Star class inside the package, both extending from Item class
in the engine

Since Super Mushroom and Power Star are both consumable items, I will add a ‘Consumable’ interface 
for consumable items so that OCP is followed if any future consumable items are added. 
Both Super Mushroom and Power Star will implement this interface.

Created actions package and added a ConsumeAction class to handle the action of consuming the consumable items, 
extends the Action class from engine


Added dependency between Consumable and Actor
Added dependency between Consumable and ConsumeAction
