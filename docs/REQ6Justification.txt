Add TalkAction to the ActionList in Toad's allowableActions method. 
This means anytime Player is adjacent to Toad the TalkAction will be allowed.
This follows the system already in place for actions the player can take.

TalkAction is a class that extends from the Action class.
When the execute method is called from TalkAction it will iterate through the players inventory and capabilityList
and will add sentences to a list based on the given requirements not adding the ones that shouldn't be displayed.
It will then randomly select one to be returned which will then be displayed through the processActorTurn method in World class.

This implementation doesn't modify any existing classes and only adds new ones showing and more conditional dialogue options can be easily added
clearly showing the Open-Closed Principle.
