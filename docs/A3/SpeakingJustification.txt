Monologue is a new class to represent a sentence an Actor can say. This allows us to easily extend the functionality being
much better than simply using a String. Monologue stores a String representing the sentence to be said and a condition
in the case that it is talking to another Actor. This condition is a Capability the Actor must have in order to speak
that Monologue.

MonologueList is a class to store Monologues. This is useful as it allows us to add functionality such as randomly
selecting a Monologue, adhering to OCP and SRP

As all NPCs can talk, a 1 to 1 association with MonologueList is added to store all the Monologues the NPC can speak.
The playTurn method in NPC checks if there is the TALK status, picking a random Monologue to speak, if not then it will
add the TALK status. This implements the talking on alternating turns for every NPC.

With the new Monologue and MonologueList the TalkAction was modified to use these classes.
